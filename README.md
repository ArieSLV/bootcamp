# RavenDB Bootcamp
![ravendb logo](images/ravendb-logo.png)

So you want to learn [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/ "RavenDB is the premier NoSQL database for .NET"). That's great! Please, welcome. This bootcamp is a free, self-directed learning course.

Over just three units you will learn how to create fully-functional, real-world programs with NoSQL Databases using RavenDB. If you know nothing about NoSQL, don't worry, we will provide all information you need.

We recommend you at least one lesson per day, but you can do it at whatever pace you wish.

## What will you learn?

In RavenDB bootcamp, you will learn how to use RavenDB - a powerful NoSQL database engine, safe by default, optimized for efficiency - which combines the best of the relational and document worlds.

You will see how easy it is to store and query data using RavenDB and how fast you can produce valuable results. Document databases store data in a very natural way.

After completing this bootcamp, you will be confident to store your data using NoSQL. Dealing with the database will become a fun process.

### Unit 1 - Fundamentals

In Unit 1, you will learn the fundamentals of RavenDB.

First, you will learn how to install and make it work on your machine. As you will see, RavenDB makes easy to start providing an embedded sample Database (if you guess "Northwind," yes! You are right.) which you can use learn with minimal effort. Then, you will write some code to connect to the database and quickly store, load, modify and delete documents.

* [Lesson 1: From installation to usage](src/Unit-1/lesson1)
* [Lesson 2: Let's code](src/Unit-1/lesson2)
* [Lesson 3: Basics of the `DocumentStore`](src/Unit-1/lesson3)
* [Lesson 4: Loading documents](src/Unit-1/lesson4)
* [Lesson 5: Querying fundamentals](src/Unit-1/lesson5)
* [Lesson 6: Storing, modifying and deleting documents](src/Unit-1/lesson6)
 
### Unit 2 - Beyond the basics

In Unit 2, you are going to learn intermediate RavenDB features. You will see how fast RavenDB is and understand the why. 

As you will learn, you can perform very complex queries easily using  only RavenDB (without additional tools). For example, you will understand what is Map-reduce and know when to use it to extract more value from your data.

* [Lesson 1: Getting started with indexes](src/Unit-2/lesson1)
* [Lesson 2: Creating an index and querying using it](src/Unit-2/lesson2)
* [Lesson 3: Multi-map indexes](src/Unit-2/lesson3)
* [Lesson 4: Mapping(, filtering) and reducing](src/Unit-2/lesson4) 
* [Lesson 5: The powerful LoadDocument server-side function](src/Unit-2/lesson5)
* [Lesson 6: Getting started with Transformers](src/Unit-2/lesson6)
* [Lesson 7: Statistics and some words about stale indexes!](src/Unit-2/lesson7)

### Unit 3 - Almost advanced!

In Unit 3, you will learn some Advanced RavenDB features. 

You do not need to know these features in your daily work. Anyway, you can use this knowlodge to build very powerful solutions, obtaining still better performance, improved safety or creating trully reactive user interfaces.

* [Lesson 1: Document Metadata](src/Unit-3/lesson1)
* [Lesson 2: Getting started with Commands!](src/Unit-3/lesson2)
* [Lesson 3: Performing batch operations](src/Unit-3/lesson3)
* [Lesson 4: I am going through changes ...](src/Unit-3/lesson4)
* [Lesson 5: Working with Listeners](src/Unit-3/lesson5)

[Let's begin!](src/Unit-1/lesson1).

That is all. Enjoy the RavenDB bootcamp and feel free to provide us your feedback.

# RavenDB Bootcamp

The [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/ "RavenDB is the premier NoSQL database for .NET") Bootcamp is a free, self-directed learning course that is up-to-date for RavenDB 4.0.

In just three units you will learn how to use RavenDB to create fully-functional, real-world programs with NoSQL Databases. If you are unfamiliar with NoSQL, don't worry, we will provide you with all the information you need.

We suggest you go through at least one lesson per day, but you can learn at your own pace.

## What You Will Learn

The RavenDB Bootcamp will teach you how to use RavenDB - a powerful NoSQL database engine that is Safe by Default and Optimized for Efficiency to combine the best of two worlds: relational and document–oriented databases.

You will see how easy it is to store and query data using RavenDB and how fast you can produce results.

After you complete this boot camp, not only will you be confident to store your data using NoSQL, database work will actually become fun.

### Unit 1 - Fundamentals

You will learn how to install RavenDB and make it work on your machine. RavenDB makes starting easy by providing an embedded sample database – think "Northwind", which you can use for your learning process with minimal effort. 

You will write some code to connect to the database and store, load, modify, and delete documents.

* [Lesson 1: Getting Started](src/unit1/lesson1)
* [Lesson 2: It's Querying Time!](src/unit1/lesson2)
* [Lesson 3: Let's Code](src/unit1/lesson3)
* [Lesson 4: Basics of DocumentStore](src/unit1/lesson4)
* [Lesson 5: Loading Documents](src/unit1/lesson5)
* [Lesson 6: Querying Fundamentals in the C# side](src/unit1/lesson6)
* [Lesson 7: Storing, Modifying and Deleting documents](src/unit1/lesson7)

### Unit 2 - Beyond the Basics

In Unit 2, you will learn intermediate RavenDB features. You will see how fast RavenDB is and understand why.

You will easily perform very complex queries without using additional tools. You will learn what Map-Reduce is and when to use it to extract more value from your data.

* [Lesson 1: Getting Started with Indexes](src/unit2/lesson1)
* [Lesson 2: Creating an Index and Querying It](src/unit2/lesson2)
* [Lesson 3: Multi-map Indexes](src/unit2/lesson3)
* [Lesson 4: Mapping, Filtering, and Reducing](src/unit2/lesson4)
* [Lesson 5: The Powerful LoadDocument Server-Side Function](src/unit2/lesson5)
* [Lesson 6: Goodbye Transformers, Welcome Server-Side Projections](src/unit2/lesson6)
* [Lesson 7: Statistics and Some Words About Stale Indexes!](src/Unit-2/lesson7)

### Unit 3 - Advanced Features

In Unit 3, you will learn some advanced RavenDB features.

Use this knowledge to build powerful solutions, obtain better performance, improve safety, and create truly reactive user interfaces.

* [Lesson 1: Revisions](src/unit3/lesson1)
* [Lesson 2: Document Metadata](src/unit3/lesson2)
* [Lesson 3: Getting Started with Operations and Commands!](src/unit3/lesson3)
* [Lesson 4: Performing Batch Operations](src/unit3/lesson4)
* [Lesson 5: I am Going Through Changes ...](src/unit3/lesson5)
* [Lesson 6: Data Subscriptions - I would Like to be Notified When it Happens Please](src/unit3/lesson6)

### Unit 4 - Cluster!

In Unit 4, you will learn the basics about how to set up, manage and use clusters using RavenDB.

Use this knowledge to build available and resilient databases solutions.

* [Lesson 1: Setting up your first cluster](src/unit4/lesson1)
* [Lesson 2: Database and Database Group](src/unit4/lesson2)
* [Lesson 3: Considerations on the client side.](src/unit4/lesson4)
